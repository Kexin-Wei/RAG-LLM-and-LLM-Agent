# Environment Setup
If you want to try this out, you need to get an API key from Google. You can get one here: https://g.co/ai/idxGetGeminiKey. And create a `.env` file with the following content:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-api-key
```

other AI keys should be added in the same place accordingly, like
 - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
 - `LANGCHAIN_KEY`
 - `TAVILY_API_KEY`
