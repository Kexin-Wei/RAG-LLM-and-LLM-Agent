My background in medical robotics and AI, coupled with my proven ability to translate research into practical commercial applications, aligns well with the job description's requirements. While my experience is not directly in next-generation sequencing (NGS), my transferable skills and rapid learning aptitude make me a compelling candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience as a Research and Development Engineer at Creative Medtech Solutions Pte. Ltd. provided a robust foundation in developing and implementing complex systems.  I successfully engineered robotics control systems, implemented AI-based medical image processing techniques (including segmentation, DICOM, and US/MRI registration), and developed power calibration and motion tracking algorithms.  My contributions resulted in three filed medical algorithm patents, demonstrating my innovative problem-solving and intellectual property generation capabilities. This experience instilled in me a deep understanding of the rigorous validation and documentation processes crucial for bringing medical technologies to market—a skillset directly transferable to NGS workflow development and validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "My subsequent role as Scrum Master at Creative Medtech Solutions further enhanced my leadership and project management skills. I successfully led the standardization of Git workflows, integrated the GoogleTest framework, and implemented Scrum processes and code review standards, demonstrating my ability to manage projects effectively and foster collaborative team environments. This experience is directly relevant to leading the implementation of NGS service workflows in a commercial laboratory setting, as described in the job description.\n",
      "\n",
      "My Master of Engineering in Medical Robotics from the National University of Singapore (GPA: 4.63/5.00) and my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Design, Manufacture, and Automation from Tongji University (GPA: 4.61/5.00) provided a strong theoretical foundation in engineering principles and a deep understanding of complex systems. My Master's thesis, focusing on deep reinforcement learning for robot-assisted surgical training, honed my research and analytical skills. My experience as a teaching assistant for Motor Characteristics and Machine Vision modules demonstrates my commitment to knowledge sharing and mentorship, a skill I am confident in applying to training technical personnel at MiRXES.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although my expertise lies primarily in robotics and AI, my proficiency in C++, Python, and MATLAB, coupled with my experience in data analysis and algorithm development, makes me a quick learner adaptable to new technologies. I am confident in my ability to rapidly acquire the necessary NGS knowledge and contribute meaningfully to your team. My strong academic record and practical experience in a fast-paced commercial environment position me to quickly become a valuable asset to MiRXES.\n",
